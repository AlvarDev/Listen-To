    <string name="s_new_divide">I remember black skies\n
        The lightning all around me \n
        I remember each flash\n
        As time began to blur\n
        Like a startling sign\n
        That fate had finally found me\n
        And your voice was all I heard\n
        That I get what I deserve\n
        \n
        So give me reason\n
        To prove me wrong\n
        To wash this memory clean\n
        Let the floods cross\n
        The distance in your eyes\n
        Give me reason\n
        To fill this hole\n
        Connect this space between\n
        Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies\n
        Across this new divide\n
        \n
        There was nothing inside\n
        The memories left abandoned\n
        There was nowhere to hide\n
        The ashes fell like snow\n
        And the ground caved in\n
        Between where we were standing\n
        And your voice was all I heard\n
        That I get what I deserve\n
        \n
        So give me reason\n
        To prove me wrong\n
        To wash this memory clean\n
        Let the floods cross\n
        The distance in your eyes\n
        Across this new divide\n
        \n
        In every loss in every lie\n
        In every truth that you deny\n
        And each regret and each goodbye\n
        Was a mistake too great to hide\n
        And your voice was all I heard\n
        That I get what I deserve\n
        \n
        So give me reason\n
        To prove me wrong\n
        To wash this memory clean\n
        Let the floods cross\n
        The distance in your eyes\n
        Give me reason\n
        To fill this hole\n
        Connect this space between\n
        Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies\n
        Across this new divide\n
        Across this new divide\n
